# Wagtail GSoC 2024: proposal draft reviews

Use this form to share your draft proposals in Google Docs, with mentors for review. This form is only for _draft_ proposals – final proposal need to be submitted on <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>, or they won’t be considered.

If you’re not sure where to start, we provide an optional template for applications: [Wagtail GSoC 2024 | Application template](./application-template.md). If you don’t use this template, still make sure to follow Google guidance on [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

- Make sure your document is set to "Anyone on the Internet with the link can comment".
- Mentors will review proposals sent up to April 1st, on a "first come first served" basis.
- You may submit your proposal for review twice: once for an initial review, and again for a final review.
- To request feedback about a specific aspect of the proposal, use Google Docs comments to indicate where you wish the reviewer to give feedback.
