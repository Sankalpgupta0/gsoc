Hi ðŸ‘‹ Wagtail GSoC admin here â€“ just wanted to confirm we are officially taking part in Google Summer of Code this year. We have less availability from organization administrators and mentors than usual, hence the slow updates.

Please make sure to check out our latest list of project ideas (https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md), with two new options with more mentors which we hope will be compelling for a lot of people.

A great way for applicants to stand out will be to demonstrate awareness of the current direction of Wagtail as a project. Consider joining events like our Whatâ€™s New in Wagtail Webinar, https://wagtail.org/blog/whats-new-in-wagtail-cms-march-2024/.

This will be my last contact over email â€“ for future updates, be sure to subscribe to Wagtail GSoC Discussions: https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions.
