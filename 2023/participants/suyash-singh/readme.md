## Introduction
Greetings Everyone! I am Suyash Singh, a pre-final year student pursuing Computer Science.

I have been into Backend and Django for the past Year. I have two intern experiences where I got to work on production code. I was always interested in writing Open Source code. As there seems nothing comparable to Open Source when it comes to writing clean code which can be read further down the line. I have been contributing to Wagtail since September last year and can confidently say that, the things that I have learnt with Open Source, I couldn't have possibly learnt anywhere else. I also love to see that each contributions in Wagtail gets recognized. GSOC is a great project that supports the students and organisations, and would love to be a part of this reputed program!

I also love reading about distributed systems and system design in my free time. I have participated and won National Level Hackathons like Smart India Hackathon!

### Interested work
[RFC 72: Background workers](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2023#rfc-72-background-workers)

[InlinePanel Ordering Issues](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/9391) This issue took me weeks to understand, however couldn't come to a solution due to poor frontend skills. Maybe with some guidance from the mentors this summer, I can apply a simple fix.

[Convert Wagtail Views to Class Based Views](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/8365) I started work on this issue, however due I diverted my attention to other wagtail issues. This summer I don't have any commitments, so would love to tackle this and migrate the views to CBV.
