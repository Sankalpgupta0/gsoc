# Introduction

Hi,

I'm Hanoon, a sophomore computer science and engineering student from IIIT, Delhi in India. I have huge interest in open source development and I came across Wagtail a few months back. Since then I have been part of its Slack discussions and code fixes.

I have worked with lots of technical clubs in my college and do freelancing as a Web Developer. I am well experienced with Django, JavaScript and Python.

I'm excited to be part of this community and I believe GSoC will provide me an excellent opportunity to contribute more to Wagtail ðŸ˜ƒ

## Tasks

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
    - [x] Your GitHub profile
    - [x] Your Twitter profile if any
    - [x] Your Mastodown profile if any
    - [x] Your LinkedIn profile if any
    - [x] Your personal website
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your participant file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to make all of the above changes in a single pull request.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within this `gsoc` repository in the `2023/` folder.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific GSoC project idea youâ€™re interested in.
- [x] Go through our projects under the [wagtail organisation](https://github.com/wagtail) in GitHub. Create a new list with links to repositories or specific issues you would be interested in contributing to during the internship.
- [x] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit both projects you will have created as a pull request on this `gsoc` repository.

- [x] Go through Djangoâ€™s [Getting started documentation and tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/), until part 7.
- [x] Go through Wagtailâ€™s Getting started tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)


## Research

- I have decided to pick the "Greener Coding" project and have done quite a bit of research
- My primary focus was find the areas Wagtail might be consuming more energy and find what are the changes similiar CMSs do for fixing them.
- Some of my findings were the use of caching and CDN along with modern image formatting. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/modern-image-formats-avif-webp/, https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/time-to-live-ttl/
- I have also decided to look into the different energy usage with themes
- Tools like GMT and/or Greenframe can be used to evaluate energy usages of Wagtail app. https://github.com/marmelab/greenframe-cli
- I still got some more work to do, I will soon update my findings here

### Interested Repositories and Issues
I will update this list as I research through more issues and repos
