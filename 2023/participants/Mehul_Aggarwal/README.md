# INTRODUCTION
Greetings Everyone! <br>
- My name is Mehul Aggarwal aka `AceHunterr`, a second-year undergraduate from National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur. My origin is from Haridwar,India.
- I've been spending my development life with Python since two years and Django for just over a year. During the journey I've got myself familiar with several other techstack such as
    - Front-End Tools:
        - HTML
        - CSS
        - Bootstrap
        - Javascript (Vanilla JS and Babel)
        - React 
    - Backend-End Tools:
        - Node.js
    - Frameworks:
        - Django
        - Flask
    - UI/UX Tools
        - Canva
        - Figma
    - Computer Languages
        - Python 
        - MATLAB
        - C++
    - Version Control
        - Git
    

- If you'll find me absent on github I'll probably be watching some anime (P.S : Haikyu is my favourite anime :)  ) or playing badminton or cricket.
- Some of my work so far or the contributions I've made to various projects:
    - [Moodify](https://github.com/AceHunterr/moodify) - A web application that detects your face expression and suggest you songs , videos etc.
    - [Digital Image Processing](https://github.com/AceHunterr/Digital_Image_Processing) - An OPEN CV project that helps the converting facial potraits into vectors art using fourier transform.
    - [Playify](https://github.com/AceHunterr/song_playlist) - A web application that allows you to retrieve playlist of old songs,videos according to time as well as region.
    - [Prodyogiki 2023 Website](https://github.com/AceHunterr/prody-2023)(Under Development) - A website for listing of events and registration for college students for technical fest.
    - [MATCOM 2023 Website](https://github.com/TeamMatcom/website-main)(Under Development) - A website for hosting technical projects for the club of the college.

    - [x] Read the official [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and add the most important dates as reminders on your calendar.
    - [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions/1) discussion thread.

- ## Open Source Contributions

    - [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
    - [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
    - [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
    - [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
    - [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Project I'm interested: 
### Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact

<hr>

## Research

* Here's my understanding of Green Coding : <br>
Green Coding aims to reduce the Carbon footprint(in simple terms the greenhouse gases) and work towards environmental sustainability.Very simple ways of achieving green coding is through efficiently using processors and managing memory hence optimising energy consumption.Hence by achieving green coding Wagtail can play a huge role in today's scenario of climate change as a CMS.

<br>

### Implementations required
As mentioned in the [Green Coding Project](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/blob/main/project-ideas.md), the issues that needs to be addressed:

* <b>Dark Theme for Admin Panel</b>: Mentioned in [Issue 10056](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10056), the admin panel has to be implemented into dark theme.

* <b>Responsive Image Optimisation</b>: Mentioned in [Issue 71](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/blob/main/text/071-responsive-images-support.md), the idea behind the image optimisation is reducing the usage of multiple `{% image %}`  tag so as to reducing unnecessary code lines.

Other implementation would be optimising code,eliminating dead code and using methods like 'prefers-reduced-motion' to reduce the CPU usage and 'prefers-reduced-data' to reduce the internet traffic.
