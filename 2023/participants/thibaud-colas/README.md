I’m Thibaud, core contributor to Wagtail since 2018. I work at [@torchbox](https://github.com/torchbox), primarily on Wagtail but I also occasionally do consulting on other projects, and even coding sometimes! I primarily work on UI and in particular accessibility these days but also have experience with back-end dev in JS/PHP/Python.

Outside of work, these days I spend most of my time with two little tornadoes that are 4 and 1 years old. Usually on a bike but sometimes on other modes of transportation:

For Google Summer of Code – I’m one of the Organization Administrators for Wagtail, and will also be mentoring one of the projects. I think programmes like GSoC have a very important place in open source, helping orgs like Wagtail to create a more diverse, richer community, and creating amazing opportunities for people to kickstart their careers.
